# Alabama Calendar #

### Made by [**Alfred Unenge**](https://github.com/alun0511) and [**Thomas Danielsson**](https://github.com/DanielssonThomas/) ###

## Instructions
1.  
        composer install  
2.  Remove .example from the .env.example file
        php artisan migrate  
    
3. To test this calendar you preferably need to create atleast two dummy accounts. 
You also need to add atleast one location.
For example: 

        php artisan tinker
        App\Models\Location::create(['name' => '319']);

This is so that you can test inviting and accepting or declining invites to and from other users (or just invite yourself).
